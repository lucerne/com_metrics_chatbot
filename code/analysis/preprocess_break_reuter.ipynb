      "Showers continued throughout the week inthe Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since earlyJanuary and improving prospects for the coming temporao,although normal humidity levels have not been restored,Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bagsof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seemsthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in thearrivals figures.    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to howmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting haspractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimatesaround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln thereare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,middlemen, exporters and processors.    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fitfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties inobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers havesold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment andonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports withJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrsunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrsper tonne FOB.    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/Julyat 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,Uruguay and open ports.    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs forMarch/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 timesNew York Dec for Oct/Dec.    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertiblecurrency areas.    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times NewYork July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New YorkSept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smithsaid.    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bagsagainst the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88crop.    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected tobe published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission aftercarnival which ends midday on February 27. \n",

      "BankAmerica Corp is not underpressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering andwould do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poorperformance, banking analysts said.    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delayits up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to beapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other bankingissues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest paymentson a large portion of its foreign debt.    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of theFirst Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica isunder no pressure to sell the securities into a market thatwill be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen asone of the major factors leading the First Interstatewithdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longerthan expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.    \"The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,\"said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for FinancialCommunications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed withthe offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.    \"I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could,\" saidLawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andSmith.    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer theyhave to show the market an improved financial outlook.    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types ofequities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertiblepreferred stock would encompass at least part of it.    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean alower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stockholders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.    Several analysts said that while they believe the Braziliandebt problem will continue to hang over the banking industrythrough the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely toease over the coming weeks.    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billiondlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if theinterest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mlndlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said JosephArsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not showup in the current quarter.    With other major banks standing to lose even more thanBankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analystssaid they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to wayMexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks. \n",
